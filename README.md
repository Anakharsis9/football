# football
This is a small and introductory project with Vue.js . The project is called football, because there are teams, players and the matches between the teams themselves. With the help of basic view features.js has implemented:
- CRUD for teams and players
- match setup,
- the randomness of two teams,
- the distribution of players on the field, 
- the conduct of the match.
 
I liked a project in general, and I understood more about the foundation of the framework Vue.js :+1:
